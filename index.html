                An object's constructor is defined as just a function.
                It is then differentiated from normal methods by calling it
                with the word "new" in front of it, thus constructing a new object.

              Prototype is an attribute of all functions, but is only useful
              when defining it on a constructor. This is a virtual attribute,
              but you can see the real prototype of an object by using "__proto__"
              on an object, but this is not defined in the specs and can change.

              The difference between foo.__proto__ and Foo.prototype is that
              foo.__proto__ is the prototype of that object, whereas Foo.prototype
              will be and is the prototype of all objects constructed with new Foo()

            Function.call will execute that function, but replace the normal
            "this" value with the provided value, and use any parameters
            afterwards as parameters of the function.

            Object.create creates an object with the prototype specified. This creates an object
            with an identical prototype chain as if you just did new LivingEntity(), but none
            of the code in the constructor is run, so it is preferred when creating an object
            for the purposes of a prototype chain.

            The root of the problem: Functions have a state!

          <aside class="notes">
            Functions in JavaScript are first class citizens, which means that
            they can be passed around in variables. This also means that they can
            be created whenever you want, not like in Java where objects all
            come with functions initially. This is changing in Java with lambdas.
            There are similar problems with Java and anonymous classes. However,
            these do not give the ability for methods to have a state.

              Closure is when an object is captured by a function, and can be referenced
              whenever that function is called in the future. This gets a lot of
              people in trouble, becuase they don't expect it to happen. In this
              first example, the string was captured by the function, in the second,
              it was not captured, and so it is referencing "i" when it was already
              at 10 in the future.

          <p>
            Javascript has function scope
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            If you think of a function is JavaScript as a state machine,
            scope is that state. Methods in Java cannot keep
            state without using the state of their owner object. Functions
            in JavaScript have their own state independent of their owner
            object, and this is called scope. But much like the prototype
            chain, it's not easy to view scope, and there is no official
            way to do it.

          <h2>Scope Properties</h2>
          <pre>
{
  _scope,
  variables
}
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            Every function has a scope, and when not inside of any function, the
            global scope applies. This is not an exact definition, as there is none,
            but it is useful. The "_scope" variable points to the previous scope,
            forming the scope chain. The "variables" variable is a map of all
            the variables declared in this scope and their values,
            including variables passed into the scope. Whenever a variable is declared
            in the scope, it is added to the variables map. Whenever it is initialized
            or modified, it's value is modified in the map.

        <section>
          <h2>How are closures related to the scope chain?</h2>
          <p>
            When a variable is used, the scope chain is traversed
            to find the first time the variable was declared
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            The first time the variable appears in the scope chain is the
            value that is used and modified if that variable is used or modified.
            Re-declaring a variable is a way of separating it from its previous
            existence in the scope chain.

            In the "Hello Bob!" example, the function returned was using its
            newly declared "name" variable, instead of the "helloStr" variable.

            In the setTimeout example, all 10 of the newly created functions were
            using their shared reference to i, which went up to 10 and then stayed
            there. They do not have individual references to i.

          <h2>Doing closure right</h2>

var logI = function(i){

    console.log(i);
  }
};
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  setTimeout(logI(i), 1000);
}
          </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            If you wanted to make the previous setTimeout example work,
            you have to capture "i" for each new function. Also note that
            i is now immutable within each result of logI. This is a way
            of creating immutable private variables in JavaScript.

          <aside class="notes">
            Immediately Invoked Functional Expressions are a pattern in JavaScript
            that allow variables and methods to be made private by declaring them
            inside a scope. This is how jQuery and a lot of other libraries are
            structured.

            Passing in the window object allows specific parts of
            the IIFE to be exported to the global namespace.
